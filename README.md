Brain-Computer Interface for Unconscious appearing ICU Patients with or without Cognitive Motor Dissociation

• Unconscious appearing patients are common in any ICU setting but 15-20% of these patients have cognitive motor dissociation (CMD)

• Patients with CMD demonstrate willful brain activation to motor commands, which can only be identified using EEG or fMRI

• These conscious patients have no ability to communicate with the examiner

• Brain computer interfaces (BCI) may offer a communication channel for these patients

• It is unclear if these patients would be able to activate a BCI and how this ability relates to CMD
